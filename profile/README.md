## Project Overview

DataCraft Trio is an organization dedicated to the collaborative development of a single-page web application using MongoDB. This project is a part of the final assessment for IT 6037, where students will work together to analyze, design, implement, and test a database solution while applying best practices for data access and management.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Investigate, Design, and Implement Data Access, Management, and Security:** Addressing application domain requirements (LO1).
- **Evaluate and Implement Storage Technologies:** Appropriate management of digital assets (LO2).
- **Apply HCI and UX Principles:** Develop user interfaces for accessing data (LO3).
- **Employ Core Software Development Practices:** Application to data access and management (LO4).

## Project Requirements
#### Client Requirements

You are a part of a working group that develops digital resources for school students. Your team has been asked to develop a database and later implement it as a source of information to develop a mobile or web application. The database is to contain reference materials for students on three subjects: art, mathematics and technology. Each subject can have articles with biographies of the key people as well as articles on the major art objects, events and important concepts.
A sample data file is provided with the assignement document on Canvas (SampleData.xls).
The database can be accessed by administrators, tutors and students with various access levels.

The client would like the database to have the following functionality:

* Students should be able to:
   * Browse articles by category
    * Browse articles by a keyword in the title
 

* Tutors should be able to:
  * Add or modify articles 

* Administrators should be able to:
  * Add, modify or remove articles

  
#### The project involves four key iterations

1. **Requirements Analysis & Planning:**
   - Analyze client requirements.
   - Plan and define the overall system design.

2. **Solution Design:**
   - Develop a system design document.
   - Design the data model and user access.

3. **Implementing and Testing:**
   - Create the database.
   - Develop database queries.
   - Implement the database in a web application.

4. **Finalization:**
   - Package and submit the final version of the code.
