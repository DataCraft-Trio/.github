## Project Overview

DataCraft Trio is an organization dedicated to the collaborative development of a single-page web application using MongoDB. This project is a part of the final assessment for IT 6037, where students will work together to analyze, design, implement, and test a database solution while applying best practices for data access and management.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Investigate, Design, and Implement Data Access, Management, and Security:** Addressing application domain requirements (LO1).
- **Evaluate and Implement Storage Technologies:** Appropriate management of digital assets (LO2).
- **Apply HCI and UX Principles:** Develop user interfaces for accessing data (LO3).
- **Employ Core Software Development Practices:** Application to data access and management (LO4).

## Project Requirements
#### Client Requirements

You are a part of a working group that develops digital resources for school students. Your team has been asked to develop a database and later implement it as a source of information to develop a mobile or web application. The database is to contain reference materials for students on three subjects: art, mathematics and technology. Each subject can have articles with biographies of the key people as well as articles on the major art objects, events and important concepts.
A sample data file is provided with the assignement document on Canvas (SampleData.xls).
The database can be accessed by administrators, tutors and students with various access levels.

The client would like the database to have the following functionality:

* Students should be able to:
   * Browse articles by category
    * Browse articles by a keyword in the title
 

* Tutors should be able to:
  * Add or modify articles 

* Administrators should be able to:
  * Add, modify or remove articles

  
#### The project involves four key iterations

1. **Requirements Analysis & Planning:**
   - Analyze client requirements.
   - Plan and define the overall system design.

2. **Solution Design:**
   - Develop a system design document.
   - Design the data model and user access.

3. **Implementing and Testing:**
   - Create the database.
   - Develop database queries.
   - Implement the database in a web application.

4. **Finalization:**
   - Package and submit the final version of the code.


## Tasks Overview:

### Task 1: Team Organisation:
* Create a team contract
* Stand-ups Meetings
* Team Process Self-Evaluation
### Task 2: Reflective Journal (Individual)
Task Deliverables:
* Evidence of personal journal entries, including:
  * Short daily status report and reflection (daily)
  * Significant team discussions and decisions (3 or more)
  * Pull request submitted (1 or more)
  * Code review received (1)
  * Team process evaluation (2 or more, middle and end of project)
* Final Reflective Journal must also include:
  * A summary of your personal contributions and Two design commentaries
  * Two implementation commentaries
  * One code review reflection
  * One testing commentary
### Task 3: Requirements Analysis & Planning:
**Planning Document**
1. As a team, analyse the client requirements presented in this document and brainstorm solutions until you come up with a possible database solution that is appropriate for this project and that is acceptable to all team members (use a decision-making method you previously agreed upon).

* The requirements for the solution from an assessment point of view are as follows:

  * Solution required is a single-page web application (web or mobile) that implements the designed database.
  * Database application needs to store test data provided using a web application.
  * Database application has authentication and authorisation as outlined in the client’s requirements. 

2. In a Planning document, summarise what you plan to include in each of the four iterations. Define a timeline for the iterations.
3. Set up a Kanban board with design and implementation tasks for each of the items in the iterations and assign the tasks. Include whole team tasks for the overall system design.
4. **Remember to take a snapshot of the board** and post it in your discussion board/ paste it into your Planning document, for evidence purposes.
5. Store the Planning documents in the shared GitHub repository. You will be updating these documents as you go through the project. (Team Leader role)
6. Once the possible solution has been identified and the Planning Document developed, **seek feedback from the tutor who will act as a client**. Record your client’s feedback and document any changes you have made to address the feedback received.

### Task 4: Solution Design:
Task Deliverables:
System Desing document, includes:
* Architecture
* Database design
* User Access design through web application
* User Experience design


#### Iteration 1: Developing System Design Document:
* **Architecture:**
  * Investigate possible database management systems appropriate to meet the requirements and select one. Justify your selection.
* **Database Design:**
  * Design the data model. Identify main entities, attributes, data types and relationships. 
   * List appropriate queries as per the requirements and planning documents.
* **User Access Design:**
  * Advise on how the user security requirements should be implemented in regard to user authentication and authorisation. Use security compliance and secure coding checklists as guidance (“security by design”).
  * Define user roles and permissions.
* **User Experience Design:**
  * Suggest views required for the overall web application.
 
**Important:**
Show the System Design document to the tutor and get their approval of the database management system, database design, queries required and implementation using web application. Get the user access and user experience designs approved as well.

### Task 5: Implementation and Testing:

#### Iteration 2: Developing the Database
1. Set up your development environments.

2. Set up and test your GitHub repository. Create a ReadMe file.

3. Create the database in the approved database management system. Follow the approved database model to create the appropriate database structure.

4. Enter the test data provided. Test the data recorded and displayed correctly.

5. Make sure your GitHub repository has the latest version of the database.

6. Show the database to the client (the tutor) and get the client’s approval.
#### Iteration 3: Developing Database Queries
1. Design, code and unit test appropriate queries to support user stories per client requirements.

2. Perform functional testing using a test plan, record test results and bugs found in a Testing document. It is most effective to test each other’s features.

3. Fix critical/major bugs.

4. Make sure your GitHub repository has the latest version of the database.

5. Show the queries to the client (the tutor) and get the client’s approval.
#### Iteration 4: Implementing Database using Web Application
1. Create a single page application (web or mobile) using any web application development language (suggestions include but are not limited to HTML, CSS, Java script, Java, Kotlin, objective C, Swift etc).

2. Connect this application (web or mobile) with the database you designed from iteration 2 and 3 so you can implement user access as per the solution design document. Use appropriate server-side programming languages (suggestions include but are not limited to Node.js, PHP, Java, Ruby, Python etc.).

3. Show the application to the client (the tutor) and get the client’s approval.
#### Packaging:
4. Once you get the client’s approval for iteration 4, download the final version of the code into a zip file, ready for submission.





## Instructions for Team Members

- **Collaboration Channels:** Use the provided channels (e.g., Teams, GitHub) for effective communication and collaboration.
- **Standing Meetings:** Participate in daily standing meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and plans.
- **Reflective Journal:** Maintain a reflective journal to document individual contributions and reflections.

## Getting Started

For detailed information on the project, refer to the [Project Wiki](link-to-wiki). Each team member is encouraged to explore and contribute to the shared knowledge base.

**Note:** This project is part of the final assessment for IT 6037 - Data Access and Management (October 2023) and will be assessed both as a team and as an individual.

Happy coding!
